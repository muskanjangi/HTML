“Documents and resources are stored on the web system. They can be accessed using the internet. The internet contains a lot of things, and one of them is the web.”The internet is a big entity and the web is smaller entity.


What is Website ?
-Shows static content (fixed information).
-When you reload, the page usually does not change (unless updated by the owner).
-User interaction is very limited (just reading, clicking links).
Example: A company’s “About Us” page.

What is Web Application ?
-Shows dynamic content (changes depending on user actions or data).
-When you reload, the content may change (because it comes from a database or server).
-Allows a lot of user interaction (frms, accounts, shopping carts, comments).
Example: Facebook, Gmail, Amazon.

**A website = mostly read-only, static info.
**A web application = interactive, dynamic, user-driven.

What is Full-Stack Web development ?
-A web application is built using three layers: the frontend, the backend, and the database. The frontend is what users see when they open a website, such as buttons, images, and visual designs. It is developed using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React. The backend is considered the brain of the application because it handles the logic and functionalities. For example, if you play Tic Tac Toe and place three O’s consecutively, the backend determines that you are the winner. The database layer is where all the data is stored, such as LinkedIn profiles and posts. Databases can be of different types, including SQL, NoSQL, and relational databases.

Full Stack Web Development combines all three layers—frontend, backend, and database—into one skill set. A popular approach to full stack development is the MERN Stack, where M stands for MongoDB, E for Express.js, R for React, and N for Node.js. By learning the MERN Stack, one can build complete projects, start freelancing, secure a job, and eventually earn money.

What are Networks?
- Devices like computers, laptops, printers, and mobiles are systems that can connect with each other, and this connected system as a whole is called a network.
For example:
In a house, your phone, your mother’s laptop, and your father’s tablet are all connected to a Wi-Fi router. This type of network is called LAN (Local Area Network).
When cities like Delhi, Punjab, and Haryana are connected, the network is called MAN (Metropolitan Area Network).
When countries like India, China, and Nepal are connected, the network is called WAN (Wide Area Network).
Through these networks, you can share resources, communicate, send messages, and exchange information.

What is Internet?
- The Internet is the global system that connects billions of devices. It is called the network of networks. In simple words, networks like LAN, MAN, and WAN combine together to form the Internet. It is a super-entity of networks.
Within the Internet, there is the WWW (World Wide Web), which is a smaller entity where documents and resources are stored and can be accessed using the Internet.
